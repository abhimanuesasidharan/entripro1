            <h3>HTML 5</h3>
            <p>pHyerText Markup Language (HTML), alongside JavaScript and CSS, is a foundational web technology. 

                Its basic purpose is to structure text which occurs by formatting documents for display on a web page. 
                
                HTML5, released in 2014, empowered HTML to natively include multimedia elements as well, such as video and audio. More or less, this development eliminated the need for Adobe Flash Player and similar plug-ins. 
                
                Every web page has HTML embedded into it as this markup is necessary for instructing a web browser how to display text, images, and other content onto a webpage. </p>

            <h3>CSS 3</h3>
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) denotes the styling and presentation of a document. For instance, any HTML document counts on CSS to manage the visual details of the web page. 

                Layouts, colors, and fonts are all under the jurisdiction of CSS. And CSS3 — the latest edition of CSS as of 2001 — modularized CSS specifications, giving developers more flexibility overall. </p>

            <h3>JavaScript</h3>
            <p>JavaScript has been around for the past quarter of a century. The programming language is well-known for revolutionizing the web due to its dynamic capabilities. 

                Dynamic describes content that is susceptible to change, whereas static content is immovable. 
                
                Before the emergence of JavaScript, the web as a whole was static in nature. A web page was simply a block of text. 
                
                Then JavaScript came about, enabling interactivity, like scrolling, clicking, and much much more.

            <h3>Angular</h3>
            <p>Angular is a TypeScript web application framework, and a reliable component of the MEAN tech stack — or MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, And Node.js.  

                TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which extends static typing, permitting stronger type safety for detecting errors quickly. 
                
                Instead of MVC, Angular uses a model-view-viewmodel (MVVM) design pattern. An MVVM pattern also distinguishes the graphical UI from the business logic. 
                
                But in absence of a controller, the view model notifies the view of any state changes by receiving notifications from the model. 
                
                Besides its architecture, Angular is quite a versatile framework. You can build progressive web apps or utilize the framework with technologies like Cordova, Ionic, or NativeScripy to build near-native mobile apps. 
                
                You can also use Angular to build desktop apps across Mac, Windows, and Linux platforms. 
                
                Another exceptional feature of the framework is Angular’s templates which developers can leverage to create UI views rapidly, aiding the software development team in becoming more productive. </p>

            <h3>Flutter</h3>
            <p>Flutter is a UI software development kit (SDK) courtesy of Google. Along with Flutter, developers employ the speedy programming language Dart and the resourceful graphic engine Skia for building cross-platform apps. 

                Benchmarks demonstrate that Dart is even faster than JavaScript, and Skia works with APIs from a variety of development platforms to abstract platform-specific graphics and render native UIs. 
                
                Naturally, these Flutter attributes drastically reduce code development time. What’s more, Flutter’s ready-to-use widgets are markedly customizable and help save time as well. </p>

            <h3>React.js</h3>
            <p>React, or ReactJS, is a front-end JavaScript library for building UIs and UI components. React was developed and is maintained by a small team of developers at Facebook. 

            Today, React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for web development. Many major global companies use React, including Facebook and Instagram. 
            
            React uses the classic model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. In an MVC pattern, there is a separation of concerns between the presentation layer and the data access layer. 
            
            The presentation layer represents the view and the data access layer represents the model. Finally, the controller manages user interactions, pushing user input to the model and view so they can make updates accordingly. 
            
            MVC is a widespread architectural pattern for UIs. But one of React’s more unique features is its virtual DOM. 
            
            Document object models (DOMs) are application programming interfaces (APIs) that handle the way in which a document is accessed and manipulated. The DOM works with XML and HTML documents, treating them like a tree structure where each HTML element operates as an object.  
            
            DOM manipulation can be taxing on a system when it comes to syncing changes to an entire program. Virtual DOMs are an abstraction of the real thing that developers save in memory for more efficient manipulation before synchronization.  </p>

            <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
            <p>
                Bootstrap is a free and open-source web development framework. It’s designed to ease the web development process of responsive, mobile-first websites by providing a collection of syntax for template designs.
                
                In other words, Bootstrap helps web developers build websites faster as they don’t need to worry about basic commands and functions. It consists of HTML, CSS, and JS-based scripts for various web design-related functions and components.</p>

            <h3>Npm</h3>
            <p>npm is a short form of Node Package Manager, which is the world's largest software registry. The open-source web project developers use it from the entire world to share and borrow packages. The npm also acts as a command-line utility for the Node.js project for installing packages in the project, dependency management, and even version management. </p>
